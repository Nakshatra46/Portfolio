Title: Explanation of My  Portfolio Website

This portfolio website is created using two separate files: HTML and CSS.

The HTML file (index.html) is used to structure the content of the website. It contains:

Header – Displays my name and title.

About Section – Introduces myself.

Skills Section – Lists my technical skills.

Contact Section – Provides email information.

Footer – Displays copyright details.

The CSS file (style.css) is used to style the website. It controls:

Separating HTML and CSS makes the website more organized and easier to maintain.
